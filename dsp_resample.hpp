/*! \brief Resampling class uses FIR filter and Kaiser window.
 *
 * This class is designed to be created upfront and then reused repeatedly to
 * perform ongoing resampling of a given signal and so it creates its internal
 * objects, such as filters, window function and workspace buffers upfront.
 *
 * Workspace buffers are allocated by this class the first time it resamples signal
 * samples and will only resize the workspace if required on subsequent calls to
 * resample more signal samples.
 *
 * Therefore creation and first call of this class to perform resampling is slower
 * than subsequent calls due to setting everything up.
 *
 * The general algorithm is as follows:
 * 1. Fill upsample buffer with signal samples spaced with zero padding samples.
 * 2. Correct for signal attenuation caused by zero padding upsampling.
 * 3. Low pass filter the upsample buffer.
 * 4. Downsample by skipping not required samples.
 * 5. Return the resampled signal.
